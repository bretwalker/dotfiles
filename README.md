# dotfiles

## Installation

**Warning:** If you want to give these dotfiles a try, you should first fork this repository, review the code, and remove things you don’t want or need. Don’t blindly use my settings unless you know what that entails. Use at your own risk!
```bash
./bootstrap.sh
```

This will set up zsh, Oh My Zsh, and install fonts needed by the Oh My Zsh theme.

### Sensible macOS defaults

When setting up a new Mac, you may want to set some sensible macOS defaults:

```bash
~/.macos
```

This will do a bunch of macOS configuration.


### Install Homebrew formulae

```bash
~/brew.sh
```

This will install some useful apps (according to Bret)
